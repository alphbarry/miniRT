# miniRT – A Simple Ray Tracer

## 🧠 Project Overview

miniRT is a ray tracing engine developed in C as part of the 42 school curriculum. The project aims to simulate the behavior of light in a 3D environment to render photorealistic images. It serves as an introduction to computer graphics and ray tracing concepts.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Geometric Primitives**: Supports spheres, planes, and cylinders.
- **Lighting**: Implements ambient and point light sources.
- **Reflection**: Utilizes the Phong reflection model for specular highlights.
- **File Parsing**: Reads scene descriptions from `.rt` files.
- **Rendering**: Outputs images in PPM format.
